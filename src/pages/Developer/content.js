  SKILLSET: 'I am a software developer focused on web technologies. I love creating applications that are both useful and pleasing to the eye. I am an advocate of agile project management.',
  VALUES_DETAILS: 'I am good at finding small bugs in applications. I am thinking about the application from the users\' perspective, many not so obvious paths can be covered before even the QA team will get the product to test. I am interested in design and that helps me to see visual details and find mistakes early in the process.',
  VALUES_TEAMWORK: 'I think that there is always something that I can learn from my teammates. I listen to them and take into consideration their ideas. I help my colleagues whenever they need it, either in the technical area or any other.',
  VALUES_DISCIPLINE: 'I work remotely with the same level of commitment as in the office because I keep myself disciplined and focused on the things I have to do. I believe that good time management is better than external motivation.',
