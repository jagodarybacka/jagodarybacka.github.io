  ABOUT: 'I am a programming mentor - the person that will make your learning process much faster and efficient. I give lessons about web development, sharing my experience with beginners.',
  MOTIVATION: 'At the beginning of my journey with coding, I had a person that helped me a lot. He gave me a clear path of what should I learn and in what order. Before I was searching the web for the best resources but there are so many that it is so hard to choose when you don\'t have much experience. Sounds familiar? I believe that everyone who wants to learn to code can benefit from having an experienced friend that will show the right path.',
  VALUES_SESSIONS: 'I want to give my students exactly what they need. There are so many bootcamps and courses that you can attend to but having a mentor is much different. I am creating a different learning path for each person that will suit their needs. I am meeting with each of my students regularly to keep the motivation up and to solve any issues as soon as they arise.',
  VALUES_TIME: 'I believe you will learn much more when you are happy and rested. No coding at night - unless you want to! The goal is to keep the balance between learning a new skill and having an enjoyable life.',
  VALUES_EXPERIENCE: 'I am a software developer with 3 years of experience - I have much more to share with you than just coding. I teach how to approach searching for your first job, what it is like to work in the agile projects and how to develop soft skills that you will use on the daily basis.'
